# Build Fixes Applied - Expo SDK 54 Upgrade

## Issues Resolved

### 1. **Missing `expo-linking` Module**
- **Error**: `Unable to resolve "expo-linking" from "node_modules\expo-router\build\global-state\routing.js"`
- **Fix**: Installed `expo-linking` package

### 2. **Missing Asset Files**
- **Error**: `Unable to resolve asset "./assets/icon.png" from "icon" in your app.json`
- **Fix**: Removed references to non-existent assets in `app.json`:
  - Removed `icon` field
  - Removed `splash` object
  - Removed `android.adaptiveIcon.foregroundImage`
  - Removed `web.favicon`

### 3. **React `use()` Hook Error**
- **Error**: `(0, react_1.use) is not a function`
- **Root Cause**: expo-router v6 requires React 19's `use()` hook, but project had React 18
- **Fix**: Upgraded to React 19.1.0 and React DOM 19.1.0

### 4. **React Native Version Mismatch**
- **Error**: Runtime errors with PlatformConstants and TurboModules
- **Root Cause**: Expo SDK 54 requires React Native 0.81
- **Fix**: Upgraded from React Native 0.73.7 to 0.81.4

## Final Version Configuration (Expo SDK 54)

```json
{
  "expo": "~54.0.0",
  "react": "19.1.0",
  "react-dom": "19.1.0",
  "react-native": "0.81.4",
  "expo-router": "~6.0.12",
  "expo-constants": "~18.0.9",
  "expo-linking": "~8.0.8",
  "expo-status-bar": "~3.0.8",
  "@react-native-async-storage/async-storage": "2.2.0",
  "react-native-safe-area-context": "~5.6.0",
  "react-native-screens": "~4.16.0",
  "react-native-svg": "15.12.1",
  "react-native-web": "~0.21.0"
}
```

## Important Notes

### ⚠️ Expo Go Compatibility
**Expo SDK 54 with React Native 0.81 CANNOT run in standard Expo Go**. You have two options:

#### Option 1: Use Development Build (Recommended)
```powershell
# Build development client for Android
npx expo run:android

# Or for iOS
npx expo run:ios
```

#### Option 2: Scan QR with Compatible Expo Go
- Your Expo Go app must be updated to support SDK 54
- If you see "Project is incompatible", update Expo Go from Play Store

### Node.js Version Warning
React Native 0.81 officially requires Node.js >= 20.19.4, but you have v20.17.0. This may cause issues. Consider upgrading Node.js:

```powershell
# Check current version
node --version

# Upgrade using nvm or download from nodejs.org
```

## How to Run

1. **Start the dev server**:
   ```powershell
   npm run start
   ```

2. **For Android** (choose one):
   - Build and run development client: `npm run android`
   - Or scan QR with Expo Go (if updated to SDK 54)

3. **For Web**:
   - Press `w` in terminal or visit http://localhost:8081

## Migration Path

If you encounter issues with SDK 54, you can downgrade to SDK 50 (which works with React Native 0.73 and Expo Go):

```json
{
  "expo": "~50.0.17",
  "react": "18.2.0",
  "react-native": "0.73.6",
  "expo-router": "~3.4.10"
}
```

Then run:
```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules, package-lock.json
npm install
```
